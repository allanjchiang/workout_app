## 7. Trademark Analysis

### App Name: "Workout Tracker"

**Analysis:**
- "Workout" - Generic English word describing physical exercise
- "Tracker" - Generic English word describing recording/monitoring
- Combined phrase is **descriptive** and **non-distinctive**

**USPTO Search Conducted:** January 2026  
**Result:** "Workout Tracker" is a common descriptive phrase used by many applications. No exclusive trademark rights are claimed or expected.

### Similar Apps in Market

The workout tracking category contains hundreds of apps with similar descriptive names:
- "Workout Tracker & Gym Plan"
- "Simple Workout Log"
- "Exercise Tracker"
- "Fitness Tracker"

This app does not attempt to confuse consumers or trade on the reputation of any other application.

## 8. Design Independence

### UI/UX Design Rationale

The application UI was designed with the following independent considerations:

1. **Target Audience:** Elderly users unfamiliar with complex technology
2. **Design Principle:** Simplicity over features
3. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 compliance where applicable
4. **Color Scheme:** High contrast for visibility
5. **Typography:** Large, readable fonts

The design does not copy or imitate any specific existing application.
